* .au mu-law audio data is treated as linear 8 bit unsigned value in the neighbourhood relation (with radius 1).
  The neighbourhood relation should be defined with respect to the logarithmic nature of mu-law data.

* steghide uses the classes hash_set and hash_map from sgi's implementation of
  the standard template library. These two classes are not part of the official
  C++ standard but part of the GNU's libstdc++. If you happen to be on a system
  that does not include theses classes you won't be able to compile steghide.

If you find a bug, please contact us at [StegHigh](https://github.com/StegHigh/steghide) about it.
